  The aim of this folder is to collect all the file and sources needed for the project. This folder 
  contains:
	
	- The 'fire_dataset' folder that store all the images used for the network training and 
	  testing

	- The 'Full_code_network' folder that contains a small program that runs in the
	  terminal. It trains a neural network built from scratch with numpy functions and 
	  produces a .txt output containing the final parameters of each layer. You can also
	  find the .py file with the actual code we built

	- The 'ProjectWork.ipynb' file, the actual project in wich we built our model with the
	  PyTorch framework

	- The 'ProjectWork.html' file an accessible ready to use version of the project 
	  (unfortunately interactive plots are not included)

	- Two .jpeg images needed for the 'Try it yourself' part of the project

	- The .ppt and .pdf slides needed for the project presentation
